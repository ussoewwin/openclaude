// --- Sign-in key mint lease --------------------------------------------------
// Looking up the sign-in key cache and minting on a miss is not itself atomic:
// two concurrent processes for the same email can each observe an empty cache
// and both reach createKey (non-idempotent — every call mints a fresh
// credential) before either later saveAimlapiSignInKey call elects a first
// writer. That election only picks which mint gets CACHED; it does not stop
// the second mint from happening, so the loser still orphans a credential.
// This lease closes the gap by serializing the lookup-and-mint section itself:
// a loser waits on a live lease and adopts the winner's cached key instead of
// minting its own. Locked on the key-cache file's path (not a lease-only
// file) so acquiring the lease and saveAimlapiSignInKey's write are mutually
// exclusive, keeping the "check cache" read inside acquire consistent with
// the eventual write. Same acquire/reclaim shape as the checkout-time
// key-mint lease; see `KEY_MINT_LEASE_STALE_MS`.
//
// Unlike that lease, the holder's critical path here isn't just the single
// POST: mintOrAdoptSignInKey also refreshes the lease and then writes the
// cache before it's done, and each of those steps can itself wait out a lock.
// The full worst case is createKey's request timeout (60s) + the refresh's
// own async-lock wait (up to LOCK_TIMEOUT_ASYNC_MS, 15s) + the cache save's
// own async-lock wait (another 15s) — 90s back to back, with zero room left
// for scheduling or filesystem overhead if this were sized to exactly that.
// Generous margin on top keeps a legitimately still-working holder from
// losing the lease to a peer moments before its result is cached.
